2. **[TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)**: A statically-typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code reliability and maintainability.
3. **[HTML Webpack Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin)**: Simplifies HTML file creation and injection of bundled scripts into the HTML template.
4. **[Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass)**: A popular CSS preprocessor that provides advanced features and improves CSS code organization.
5. **[PostCSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss)**: A versatile CSS tool that enhances and transforms styles using plugins.
